The Login Workflow

Flattrade’s login is a bit unique. You don't just send a password; you need to generate a request_token via a browser first.

The Flow:

    Open URL: https://auth.flattrade.in/?app_key=YOUR_API_KEY in your browser.

    Login: Enter your UCC, Password, and TOTP.

    Redirect: It will redirect to your URL with a code: https://yourredirect.com/?request_code=XXXXXX.

    Exchange: Your Go app will take that request_code and exchange it for a permanent token for the day.
